## Project Description

This is a single page project.
It consists of a navbar and three sections. The links in the navbar are links to different sections of the page.
The three sections are as follows:

- First section : A full page with just the logo of the website at center.
- Second Section : This is the project gallery section that contains cards containing defferent projects.
- Third Section : This is a simple contact section that contains a heading and link to github.

## Overall Review

This is not some project to showoff, it is just a single page project that is under development.
If this project is to be shown off than it needs a lot of changes:

- The page needs some better font style to make it look professional.
- The contact me form needs to look better and include links other than the github link available.
- The color combination in the page can be improved.
- Adjust the height of the sections, make the project gallery section cover the whole page excluding the height used by the navbar.

Do not use this project before making the changes.
